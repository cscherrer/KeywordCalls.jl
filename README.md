**WORK IN PROGRESS**

KeywordCalls allows declarations

```julia
@kwcall f(c,b,a)
```

with the result that

- Calls to `f(x,y,z)` (without keywords) are dispatched to `f(c=x, b=y, a=z)`
- Call _with_ keywords, e.g. `f(a=z, b=y, c=x)` are put back in the declared "preferred ordering", again dispatching to `f(c=x, b=y, a=z)`

Multiple declarations are allowed, as long as the set of names is distinct for each declaration of a given function.

Most of the heavy lifting is done using NestedTuples.jl and GeneralizedGenerated.jl. By taking advantage of type-level information for named tuples, we can make all of this work at compile time, so there should be no run-time overhead.
